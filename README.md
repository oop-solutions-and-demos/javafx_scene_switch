# Scene Switching in JavaFX

Demo that shows how to switch scenes in JavaFX.

It also shows how to pass data to the next controller.

Check the commits to see the difference in code between switching scene and switching scenes with data.

Make sure to remove the controller from the second fxml file when passing data, otherwise you will get the error `Caused by: javafx.fxml.LoadException: Controller value already specified.`.
